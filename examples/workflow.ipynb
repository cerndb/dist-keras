An other requirement was those models should be trained on their complete dataset, which is in the order of a TB. At this point, production use-cases for ATLAS are also being evaluated.

    "## Distributed Deep Learning, an introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised feature learning and deep learning has shown that being able to train large models can dramatically improve performance. However, consider the problem of training a deep network with billions of parameters. How do we achieve this without waiting for days, or even weeks, and thus leaving more time to tune the model? Dean et al. [[1]](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4687-large-scale-distributed-deep-networks.pdf) proposed an training paradigm which allows us to train a model on multiple physical machines. The authors describe two methods to achieve this, i.e., **data parallelism** and **model parallelism**<sup>1</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model parallelism<sup><span style=\"font-size: 0.75em\">2</span></sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "In model parallelism a *single* model is distributed over multiple machines. The performance benefits of distributing a deep network across multiple machines depends mainly on the structure and of the model. Models with a large number of parameters typically benefit from access to more CPUs and memory, up to the point where communication costs, i.e., propagation of the weight updates and synchronization mechanisms, dominate [[1]](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4687-large-scale-distributed-deep-networks.pdf).\n",

    "### Data parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in the introduction, in order to train a large network in a reasonable amount of time, we need to parallize the optimization process (which is the learning of the model). In this settings, we take *several* model replicas, and distribute them over multiple machines. Of course, it would also be possible to combine this with the model parallelism approach. However, for the sake of simplicity, let us assume that a model (or several models) can be contained on a single machine. In order to parallelize the training, and to improve the usage of the resources of the cluster, we distribute the models over several machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to build a distributed learning scheme using data parallelism, you would in the most simple case need at least 1 **parameter server**. A parameter server is basically a thread (or a collection of threads) which aggregate the incoming gradient updates of the workers into a so-called center variable, which acts as a *global consensus* variable. Finally, the weights which are stored in the center variable will eventually be used by the produced model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/JoeriHermans/dist-keras/blob/master/resources/data_parallelism.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Data Parallelism\" width=\"400px\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two general approaches towards solving data parallelism. The most straightforward is a **synchronous** method. In short, a synchronous data parallel method will wait for all workers to finish the current mini-batch or stochastic sample before continuing to the next iteration. Synchronous methods have the advantage that all workers will use the most recent center variable, i.e., a worker knows that all other workers will use the same center variable. However, the main disadvantage of this method is the synchronization itself. A synchronous method will never be truly synchronous. This is due to the many, and possibly different, machines. Furthermore, every machine could have a different workload, which would influence the training speed of a worker. As a result, synchronous methods need additional waiting mechanisms to synchronize all workers. These locking mechanisms will make sure that that all workers compute the next gradient based on the same center variable. However, locking mechanisms induce a significant wait which will significantly influence the training speed. For example, imagine a cluster node with an unusual high load. This high load will, due to CPU sharing, cause the training procedure to slow down. Which in turn, will cause the other workers to wait for this single node. Of course, this is just a simple and possibly extreme example, but this example shows how a single worker could significantly influence the training time of all workers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/JoeriHermans/dist-keras/blob/master/resources/synchronous_method.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Data Parallelism\" width=\"500px\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "A very simple, but radical \"solution\" for this synchronization problem is to not synchronize the workers :) Workers simply fetch the center variable and update the parameter server with the computed gradient whenever a worker is ready. This approach is called an **asynchronous** data parallel method. Asynchronous methods, compared to synchronous methods, will have a different set of problems. One of these is a so-called **stale gradient**. This a gradient based on an older version of the center variable while the current center variable is a center variable which has already been updated by other workers. One approach to solve this is to induce and exponential decay factor to the gradient updates. However, this would waste computational resources, but of course, one could just get the most recent weights from the parameter server and then start again. However, as we will show later, it is actually stale gradients (result of asynchrony) that induce *implicit momentum* to the learning process [[2]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04487v4.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/JoeriHermans/dist-keras/blob/master/resources/asynchronous_method.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Data Parallelism\" width=\"500px\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point you probably ask the question: **why does this actually work?** A lot of people suggest this is due to the sparsity of the gradients. Intuitively, image having multiple workers processing different data (since every worker has its own dat partition), chances are the weights updates will be totally dissimilar since we are training a large network with a lot of tunable parameters. Furthermore, techniques such as dropout (if they are applied differently among the replicas) only increase the sparsity updates<sup>3</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formalization\n",
    "\n",
    "We would also like to inform the reader that the general problem to be solved is the so-called **global consensus optimization** problem. A popular approach towards solving this is using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) [[3]](http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/zhange14.pdf) [[4]](http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/admm_distr_stats.pdf). However, since this is outside the scope of this notebook we will not review this in-depth. But, we would like to note that the *Elastic Averaging* methods [[5]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6651.pdf) by Zhang et al., which we included in *Distributed Keras* are based on ADMM.\n",

    "Our architecture is very similar to the architecture discussed in [[1]](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4687-large-scale-distributed-deep-networks.pdf). However, we employ Apache Spark for data parallel reading and handling larger than memory datasets. The parameter server will always be created in the **Spark Driver**. This **is the program which creates the Spark Context**. For example, if the Jupyter installation of this notebook is running on the Spark cluster, then a cluster node will host the parameter server. However, if you run a Python script, which connects to a remote Spark cluster, then your computer will run the Spark Driver, and as a result will run the parameter server. In that case, be sure your network connection is able to handle the load, else your computer will be the bottleneck in the learning process.\n",

We already supplied an *AsynchronousDistributedTrainer*, and an *SynchronousDistributedTrainer*. However, if you require an other procedure, please feel free to do so.

    "In the following sections, we will give you an example how a complete workflow will look like. This includes setting up a Spark context, reading, preprocessing, and normalizing the data.

This dataset is quite limited, it contains only **250000** instances. 40% of which we will be using as a test set. For future experiments, it would be usefull to integrate well understood datasets such as CIFAR or MNIST to evaluate against other optimizers. However, it would be nice to have a \"well understood\" HEP (High Energy Physics) dataset for this task :) "

    "\n",
    "Distributed Deep Learning can **significantly speedup** the learning process. We provide such a framework built on top of Keras and Apache Spark. The latter provides a nice framework for distributed data processing and model evaluation. We can easily integrate our workflows using Apache Spark, and thus speeding up the **data preprocessing**, and our **model optimization procedure** while still having the same **modelling simplicity**.\n",

    "Our group is always open on further collaboration on this work, and would like to assist the physics community in their machine learning efforts.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Understanding \"theoretical\" meaning of a communication window.\n",
    "- Apply compression for big weight updates when sending updates to the parameter server.\n",
    "- Keep track of a gradient residual (this will reduce the bandwidth due to sparsity).\n",
    "- Evaluation of algorithms with GPU's.\n",
    "- Optimization of parameter sharing (e.g., sockets instead of REST API).\n",
    "- Use \"famous\" ConvNet architectures with well known datasets in order to have a more sound evaluation.\n",
    "- Add threaded queue to process asynchronous updates.\n",
    "- Training accuracy while training.\n",
    "- Stop on target loss.\n",
