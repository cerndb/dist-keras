    "## Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of building an efficient machine learning production pipeline is quite similar to building an efficient training procedure. However, in contrast to the training procedure, in production (model serving) most of this data will arrive in a streaming fashion. Usually, one just reads from a particular source using Spark Streaming. However, intergration with Apache Kafka is also possible. Kafka allows us to scale our streaming application if a bottleneck would occur. At CERN we employ Apache Kafka with different use-cases in [IT](https://db-blog.web.cern.ch/blog/prasanth-kothuri/2016-10-benchmarking-apache-kafka-openstack-vms) (IT Group), [BE](https://indico.cern.ch/event/533714/contributions/2173938/attachments/1292041/1924841/CALS2-Hadoop-IT.pdf) (Beams Group), and ATLAS.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, building a distributed streaming application has some practical considerations as mentioned in [1]. This includes specifying the *retention* (i.e., how much time is the data allowed to stay in the buffer, or what is the maximum size of the buffer before discarding older data) of the data in your buffer, usage of *compression*, number of *brokers*, *partitions*, and how to throttle incoming data. Of course, these settings are always application and infrastructure depended. But since this is a general-purpose framework, we will show in the following sections how to build a scalable deep learning production (model serving) pipeline using the technologies mentioned above."

    "\n",
    "### Installation and requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cluster requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume that you will already have a running Kafka and Spark cluster. Furthermore, in order to run this example, we require that the topic **\"Machine_Learning\"** is available on this Kafka cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kafka Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to manage your Python dependencies, it is recommended to install a Python distribution like [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). In the following sections, we assume that Spark is already added to your PATH variable. In order to run our Kafka producer (located in the *examples* directory). We first need [Kafka Python](https://github.com/dpkp/kafka-python). This is done by simply running Pip in your shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```pip install kafka-python```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pretrained model\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run a production classification pipeline you should have access to a trained model. Keras provides an API to load and store trained models. The same procedures can be used with Distributed Keras and Spark to load a pretrained model for production use-cases. However, in this example, we will construct a Neural Network with randomly initialized weights (which will simulate such a pretrained model). The structure of the model (input and output data) will be equivalent to the neural network in the *workflow notebook*. So if anyone wants to use the distributed training methods described in the workflow notebook to train a model, and afterwards save it to use the trained model in this notebook, you should not experience any problems. Just make sure the model variable is set to your trained Keras model."
